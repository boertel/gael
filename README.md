Home cooked baby feeding tracking app

After testing a few apps, I found missing pieces to my use:

- apps care about time of feeding, whereas we cared about start of feeding
- apps care about time **since** feeding, whereas we cared about _when_ is the next feeding
- at the time of creation, most feeding tracking apps didn't have interactive widgets introduced on iOS 17
- lock screen widget to know: is it time for feeding?

and as a bonus, the widget shows up in Stand By mode !
